# Arduino Mega 2560 Command Line Monitor
This project implements a basic command line monitor program for the Arduino Mega 2560 development board. The monitor was designed to allow the user to investigate the memory layout, memory contents and integrated peripherals of the soc. Future versions will support download and execution of code from memory. I wrote this code to gain experience working with small embedded hardware platforms.

The program binary is built entirely from the command line via the project makefile. A makefile target is included to flash the target board as well. The Arduino IDE must be installed as it supplies the necessary hardware specific files and build tools required to compile the target image.
